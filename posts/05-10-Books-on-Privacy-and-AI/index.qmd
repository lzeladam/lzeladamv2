If you’re like most people, you probably think that your data is pretty safe.
After all, it’s not like you’re doing anything illegal or shady – so what do you have to worry about?
Unfortunately, the truth is that our data is far from safe.

That’s why I believe that everyone should educate themselves on the concept of privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies.

I think that these books are very useful to understand the concept of privacy and the privacy enhancing technologies like Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption Secure, Federate Learning.

Privacy matters because good privacy rules can promote the essential human values of identity, power, freedom, and trust. If we want to preserve our commitments to these precious yet fragile values, we will need privacy rules

**7. Privacy in Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life**

This book claims that what people really care about when they complain and protest that privacy has been violated is not the act of sharing information itself―most people understand that this is crucial to social life ―but the inappropriate, improper sharing of information.
